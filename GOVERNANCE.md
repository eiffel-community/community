# Eiffel Community Governance

Eiffel is a protocol for technology agnostic machine-to-machine communication in continuous integration and delivery pipelines, aimed at securing scalability, flexibility and traceability.
Eiffel is based on the concept of decentralized real time messaging, both to drive the continuous integration and delivery system and to document it.

Governance of the Eiffel Community is structured according to this document.
This structure is intended to provide a healthy, sustainable and attractive community for Eiffel development and collaboration.

The Eiffel community proactively adopts and follows best practices employed by successful open source communities while maintaining a governance agreeable to its members.

Governance of the Eiffel Community is the responsibility of Eiffel Technical Committee.

## Projects

The projects that take part in Eiffel Community develop solutions in order to contribute to Eiffel vision of technology agnostic machine-to-machine communication in CI/CD pipelines.
The work done within the projects can focus on specific areas such as security, visualization, and ease of use or contribute to and drive the high level architecture or the protocol itself which impacts the entire community.

The projects that constitute Eiffel Community are self governing, meaning that project related work is done and decisions are taken within the projects.

The projects that take part in Eiffel Community currently have two roles relevant to their governance: contributors and maintainers.

### Contributors

A contributor is anyone who made contributions to any of the projects within Eiffel Community.

There are different means and ways to contribute to Eiffel Community in order to be a contributor, such as issuing and reviewing pull requests, creating issues in project backlog, or taking part in technical discussions.
Determination of the complete criteria for contributors is the responsibility of the Eiffel Technical Committee with the input from Eiffel Community at large.

Contributors are eligible to vote on Technical Committee elections. Contributors do not have the rights to accept pull requests.

Being contributor is a prerequisite for becoming a maintainer to the projects they are contributing to.
In order for a contributor to become a maintainer, the individual must be nominated by one of the existing maintainers with a reference to the individual's history of contributions to the project.
The nomination is done as a pull request to the *CODEOWNERS* file in corresponding project's git repository. The approval must be done on the pull request by project's maintainers.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are active contributors and participants in the projects they are maintainers of. Maintainers have the rights to accept pull requests.

Maintainers are eligible to vote on Technical Committee elections. They can be nominated as members to the Technical Committee during Technical Committee elections.

Maintainers have right to nominate contributors to become maintainers and vote on the maintainer promotions for the projects they are maintainers of.

Individuals can be maintainers to multiple Eiffel Community Open Source Projects.

## Technical Committee

The Technical Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Eiffel Community Open Source Projects. Technical Committee is comprised of **X** voting members.

The term for Technical Committee is **one year**.

The responsibilities of the Technical Committee are

* coordination of the technical direction of the project(s)
* discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters that affect multiple Eiffel Community Open Source Projects
* serving as point of contact with regards to licensing matters

Eiffel Community aims to operate as a consensus based community, if any decision requires a vote to move the Eiffel Community Open Source Projects forward, the members of the Technical Committee will vote on a one vote per member basis.
Simple majority is required for any decision to be approved. When voting in a meeting, it is a simple majority of the voting members present.  When voting through email or other forms of asynchronous communication, it is a simple majority of all TSC voting members.

The Technical Committee meets regularly and the meetings are intended to be open to the public and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.
Quorum for Technical Committee meetings requires at least a majority of all voting members of the Technical Committee to be present.
The Technical Committee  may continue to meet if quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

* Code of conduct guidelines
* Contribution process
* Security/Vulnerability reporting and response processes

### Community Vision, Mission, and Goals

This document will include the community vision, mission, and goals by taking different audiences into account such as developers, and decision makers.

### Technical Committee Charter

This document will define how the committee is to manage the project until it has transitioned to an elected steering body, as well as what governance must be in place.

A charter should cover all of the following topics:

* Scope of rights and responsibilities explicitly held by the committee
* Committee structure
* Election process, including:

    * Is there a member note taker, or is there a neutral facilitator role that exists outside of the committee?
    * Frequency, duration, and required consistency
  * Committee decision-making process, and specifically those areas of action that require more/less consensus, e.g. modifications the charter

### Project Guidelines

This document will contain information for the existing and new Eiffel Community Open Source Projects with regards to

* identification and clarification of the existing projects
* visibility of the maintainers
* project proposal process
* project lifecycle
* project communication channels

### Code of Conduct

The code of conduct MUST set expectations for contributors on expected behavior, as well as explaining the consequences of violating the terms of the code.
The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) has become the de facto standard for this language and has already been in use by the Eiffel Community.
The code of conduct document must state The ways for community to issue code of conduct violations clearly.

### Contribution Process

Bootstrap Technical Committee MUST define a contribution process that:

* Explains to potential contributors how/if they can add code to the repository/repositories
* Documents Workflow and management of pull requests
* Identifies who is authorized to commit or revert code
* Identifies automation is required for normal operations
* Defines release mechanisms, cadence and how release decisions are made
  * Who is authorized to release and when.
  * Frequency limits
* Defines the documentation process
* Defines what CLA process is required and how it is programmatically enforced before code is merged

### Security/Vulnerability Reporting and Response Process
* Identify and document where vulnerability reporting can be done to the project
* Identify and document who is responsible for receiving vulnerability reports
* Document process responsible parties go through to triage and determine veracity of vulnerability
* Document process for facilitating fix, generating release update, and communicating vulnerability and fix to public

## Transition Process

Bootstrap Technical Committee MUST

* Organize, execute, and validate an election for replacing members of the Technical Committee
* Define the term lengths for newly-elected individuals, ideally so not all members change out at once
* Provide documentation for the community and committee members sufficient to smoothly continue the established practices of the committee

The members of the Bootstrap Technical Committee may re-run during the election but they would need to be re-elected in order to stay.
