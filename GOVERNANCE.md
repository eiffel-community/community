## Introduction

Eiffel is a protocol for technology agnostic machine-to-machine communication in continuous integration and delivery pipelines, aimed at securing scalability, flexibility and traceability.
Eiffel is based on the concept of decentralized real time messaging, both to drive the continuous integration and delivery system and to document it.

Governance of the Eiffel Community is structured according to this document.
This structure is intended to provide a healthy, sustainable and attractive community for Eiffel development and collaboration.

The Eiffel community proactively adopts and follows best practices employed by successful open source communities while maintaining a governance agreeable to its members.

Governance of the Eiffel Community is the responsibility of Eiffel Technical Committee.

## Projects

The projects that take part in Eiffel Community develop solutions in order to contribute to Eiffel vision of technology agnostic machine-to-machine communication in CI/CD pipelines.
The work done within the projects can focus on specific areas such as security, visualization, and ease of use or contribute to and drive the high level architecture or the protocol itself which impacts the entire community.

The projects that constitute Eiffel Community are self governing, meaning that project related work is done and decisions are taken within the projects.


## Project Roles

The projects that take part in Eiffel Community currently have two roles relevant to their governance: contributors and maintainers.

### Contributors

A contributor is anyone who made contributions to any of the projects within Eiffel Community.

There are different means and ways to contribute to Eiffel Community in order to be a contributor, such as issuing and reviewing pull requests, creating issues in project backlog, or taking part in technical discussions.
Determination of the complete criteria for contributors is the responsibility of the Eiffel Technical Committee with the input from Eiffel Community at large.

Contributors are eligible to vote on Technical Committee elections. Contributors do not have the rights to accept pull requests.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are active contributors and participants in the projects they are maintainers of. Maintainers have the rights to accept pull requests.

In order for a contributor to become a maintainer for a certain project, the individual must be nominated by one of the existing maintainers of that project with a reference to the individual's history of contributions to the same project. The nomination is discussed and voted on amongst the maintainers. Unless unanimous approval within the maintainers group can be reached, the Technical Committee can be consulted for advice. If approved, the nominated contributor must be added to the GitHub team for the maintainers of this project.

Maintainers have a responsibility towards the code and content of the projects and repositories they maintain. This means the maintainer is expected to enforce the following:
* Inclusive and non-offensive content
* Adequate overall code quality
* Reasonable test coverage
* Reasonable security and vulnerability scanning

A good default for security and vulnerability scanning is to have [Dependabot Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts), [Dependabot Security Updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates) and [Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) enabled. All these settings can be found under _Settings -> Code and Security Analysis_

Maintainers are eligible to vote on Technical Committee elections. They can be nominated as members to the Technical Committee during Technical Committee elections.

Individuals can be maintainers to multiple Eiffel Community Open Source Projects.

For guidelines on how to contribute, please see [our contribution guidelines](https://github.com/eiffel-community/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Elected members of the Technical Committee assume their seat during the first Technical Committee Meeting following the completion of the election phase.

#### Exceptions

There could be cases where Election Officers may need to follow different processes to ensure the election process can be completed.

One such case is the number of candidates who run for the Technical Committee elections.
If the number of candidates is less than the number of seats in Technical Committee, Election Officers are authorized to extend the nomination period for one more week. If the number of candidates is still less than the number of seats in Technical Committee, Election Officers are authorized to end the nomination and election process so all the candidates assume their seats without election. The remaining seats are left vacant. The new Technical Committee is responsible to determine if, when, and how to fill the vacant seats.
If the number of candidates is equal to the number of seats in Technical Committee, Election Officers are authorized to end the nomination and election process so all the candidates assume their seats without election.

In addition to handling exceptions that may occur during community elections, Election Officers are responsible to guide the Technical Committee and Eiffel Community at large in case someone resigns from the Technical Committee or is impeached. Technical Committee is responsible of determining how to fill vacant seat and special elections can be held if the Technical Committee deems it necessary. Otherwise, the seat can be left vacant or a community member can be appointed by the Technical Committee.

#### Exceptions

Technical Committee is ultimately responsible for if, when, and how the chair will be elected.

Technical Committee may decide to run the election as documented in this chapter or the committee may well decide to use a lightweight process such as electing the chair from within itself during the very first meeting the new members of the committee assume their seat.
However, all members of the Technical Committee must be present in this meeting in order for this process to be valid.
Otherwise, Technical Committee may decide to run chair elections or postpone application of the lightweight process to elect chair to the next meeting.

If Technical Committee decides to hold elections for Technical Committee Chair, there could still be cases where Election Officers may need to follow different processes to ensure the election process can be completed.
One such case is the number of candidates who run for the Technical Committee Chair election.

If there is no candidate for Technical Committee Chair election, Election Officers are authorized to extend the nomination period for one more week. If there is still no candidate, Election Officers are authorized to end the nomination and election process and this matter is discussed within Technical Committee during the very first Technical Committee Meeting following the end of the nomination period. The Technical Committee is responsible to determine if, when, and how to fill the chair seat.

If the number of candidates is one and their candidacy is unchallenged, Election Officers are responsible to bring this topic to the very first Technical Committee Meeting in order to determine if an extension for the nomination period is required or the unchallenged candidate assumes their seat. Simple majority within Technical Committee is required for candidate to assume their seat.
