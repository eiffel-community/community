    * Magnus will likely join the working group himself.
* Should Sepia graduate?
    * Yes. It fulfills the graduation requirements. Draft issue for updating the README file and the landscape picture created.
    * Also, should the commnity repos that de facto are outside the normal project lifecycle be marked as such in the landscape picture? Draft issue created.
* Info: Event signing updates
    * Event signing implementation for the Go SDK is ongoing ([github.com/eiffel-community/eiffelevents-sdk-go#9](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffelevents-sdk-go/issues/9)). Will be followed by a Java implementation in the eiffel-broadcaster plugin for Jenkins.

### November 16, 2023

#### Participants

* TC Attendees
    * Emil Bäckmark, present
    * Magnus Bäck, present
    * Mattias Linnér, present

#### Agenda and Notes
* Rollcall, All
    * Quorum reached
* Agenda Bashing, All
    * Approved.
* Action Item Review, All
    * Follow up [the TC GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/projects/3/views/4)
    * Follow up [the Eiffel protocol project board](https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/projects/6)
* Updates from CDF sig-events, Emil & Mattias
    * Link discussion ongoing.
* Should we keep the not-yet-introduced dormant state?
    * No, we don't need it. Let's stick with the archived state. We can always open up a repository again if needed.
    * Close [github.com/eiffel-community/community#156](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/156) with an explanation of why we don't need the state.
    * Update [github.com/eiffel-community/community#148](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/148) to mention that we should inform on mailing list & Slack some time before archiving. The Jenkins community's process for taking over an abandoned plugin can be used as an inspiration.
* JSON Schema deprecation support - https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-00#rfc.section.9.3. Do we want to use it?
    * Yes, possibly. We need to upgrade the JSON Schema version before we can use the deprecation attribute. We currently don't have any fields that need to be deprecated so there's no rush.
* Should the ER lookup spec ([PR](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-event-repository/pull/12)) include references to link types?
    * No, allow any UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES strings, including the magic "ALL" value. The help text can still contain a list of all link types. By doing this we allow custom events to be used and the API spec won't be as dependent on the events.
    * We'll write an issue in the protocol repo to add an autogenerated documentation page containing all link types.
* Out of time, postponed: Should Sepia graduate?
* Out of time, postponed: PRs and issues

#### Action Items
* Emil: Look into proposal made in the maintainer role presentation from the 2021 summit.
* Magnus: Ask the security officers to try out the private vulnerability reporting feature.
* Emil: Talk to Panos about Vici's Dependabot PRs.
    * We'll merge the Dependabot PRs now.
    * Depending on whether or not we'll introduce a dormant state we'll transition the repo to either dormant or just archive it.
* All: Evaluate key repositories according to the OpenSSF criteria.
* ~~Emil: Update agenda of Nov 9 extra TC meeting to cover CDEvents and linking.~~
* ~~Emil: Update the meeting invite for Nov 23 community meeting.~~

    * Since it'll be a light-weight meetup we can start planning it when Emil & Mattias have something that's at least half-ready.

* Post-summit survey
    * Approved the current survey with a few updates. Magnus will send the survey to the attendants.
* Could we close?
    - https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/44
        - Emil will close issue.
    - https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/4
        - Emil will close issue.

        - Mattias will close issue.
    - https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/47
        - Magnus will look into the issue and see if it's okay to close.
    - https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/projects/3/views/4?pane=issue&itemId=9276722 isn't it there in https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/howtos/update-tc-members.md
        - That draft issue was archived during the meeting
* Could we merge?
    - https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-jira-plugin/pull/33

    * Action Magnus: Enable everything globally from the organization and send email to the mailing list about this change.
* We have a board to follow-up on the protocol issues. How do we follow up on community issues e.g. the newly created https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/175 (that was closed as it was a duplication, but it serves as an example)?
    * Could we set up a GH action to add new issues to a project board? Yes, [github.com/eiffel-community/community#182](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/182) created. Should cover both community repos and the protocol repo.
    * Additionally, existing issues should be added to the TC or protocol boards. Magnus already has a tracked action for this.
* How can we get some progress with all the [open documentation issues in the protocol repo](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/issues)?
    * Use next extra TC meeting for prioritizing the protocol issues, including documentation issues. Emil will update the invite to include the other protocol maintainers.

#### Participants

#### Agenda and Notes
* When should we step versions of our events. As per https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/pull/366#pullrequestreview-1573957182
    - We decided to try to be ultra strict - any change in a yaml file will result in the version stepped on the event, regardless of if it is just a spelling error or other.
* Community meeting in two weeks
    * Topic decided. See community meeting HackMd Doc.
* How should we handle email adresses? Should we display them as in https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/pull/179 or should we link to the GitHub profile instead so that the persons can decide it themselves?
    - Should we also update the list of TC members ([TC](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#technical-committee-members))? (And maybe require a TC to have a public email in its profile)
    - Decided to move the maintainers rows in the Google group table to the issue about removing Google groups
    - Decided to replace all individual mail links with links to their Github profiles

#### Agenda and Notes
* Rollcall, All
    * We have quorum.
* Appoint election officers
    - Fatih Degirmenci and Fredrik Fristedt have accepted to be Election Officers for a one-year term ending 2024-02-02.
    - https://hackmd.io/6x1Ef5Y_RWqaOmytMeYVKw#Eiffel-Technical-Committee-Elections-2023
    - Emil: Reach out to them to start by setting the timeline and come back to TC to present it when done
* https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/pull/343 - Did we say step major version for experimental link types
    * Mattias will approve it now.
    * Magnus will consider it one more night before submitting it.
* Discuss issue Eiffel vision/mission - https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/issues/190
    * Compare to distributed tracing. Where do we draw the line? Should there be a spanId attribute in one of the activity events? Should we express an opinion on how deep down in the stack Eiffel should be used (build-as-a-service example)?
    * How far towards the ops space (incidents etc)?
    * Resource monitoring was used an example of what not to cover, but why not? A possible rule that _might_ work is that events that are _only_ useful outside the pipeline but never within the pipeline shouldn't be part of Eiffel. That at least applies to the resource monitoring example. However, Eiffel can include references to where consumers can find resource usage data.
    * Eiffel should be used for events/occurences, not "current status/state".
* Postponed to next weeks TC meeting: Info project now have roadmaps - https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-31-roadmap-in-projects-public-beta/
