## Agenda and Notes

### Next

* Should we evaluate Eiffel against the [OpenSSF Security Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) and/or the [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en)?
* Should we enable Code scanning for all repos. See https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-remrem-publish/security/code-scanning for an example.
    * Set via https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-remrem-publish/settings/security_analysis
    * Workflow example: https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-remrem-publish/blob/master/.github/workflows/codeql.yml
    * We need to understand how code scanning works before we enable it globally. Do we need a workflow similar to the codeql.yml above for things to work or is it enough to just click Enable in the repo (or global) settings?
        * (2024-02-21): You can set it up globaly - https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale#eligible-repositories-for-codeql-default-setup
    * When/if decided: Enable all code scanning, Dependabot, secret scanning etc globally from the organization and send email to the mailing list about this change.
* [OpenPubkey](https://www.bastionzero.com/openpubkey) for public key distribution
* How do we document the process for adding external repos to the community?
    * What responsiblities does the Community /TC have for external repos?
    * Should the TC enforce maintainer rules on external repos?
* Should we take another look at [eventcatalog](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/), see also [example](https://app.eventcatalog.dev/visualiser/?type=all&name=AllEventsAndServices)
    * Was previously raised on [TC 2023-01-26](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/meetings/MEETINGS_TC_2023.md#agenda-and-notes-24)
* Gap analysis - CDEvents vs Eiffel. To help CDEvents reach 1.0 we should provide our input on the gap
* [JSON schema to validate PURLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/pull/514)

* For https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/community (Community Standards) - should we enable "Repository admins accept content reports"?
    * Yes, enabled for the protocol repo and community repo. See the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam) for what it means.
* GitHub package access
    * For some reason the organization had disallowed making GitHub packages public. This has been opened up via the [organization settings](https://github.com/organizations/eiffel-community/settings/packages). It's unclear when that setting was introduced or changed. At some point it was possible to pull Docker images without authentication.
