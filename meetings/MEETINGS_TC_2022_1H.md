However if you have many different individuals/companies doing contributions the files soon become cluttered with copyright statements so one might wan to find other solutions. This blog from LF touches on the subject; https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/blog/copyright-notices-in-open-source-software-projects/ 
      >
      >The readme file does not need a copyright statement as I see it. The indication of license should suffice.
