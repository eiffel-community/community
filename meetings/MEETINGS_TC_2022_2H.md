    * Approved.
* Action Item Review, All
    * The TC GitHub project: https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/projects/3/views/4
* Updates from CDF sig-events, Emil & Mattias
    * 0.2 scoping in progress with a Feb 2023 target. 0.3 targeted for April/May 2023.
* Meetings during upcoming holidays
    * Next weeks extra TC meeting? Canceled
    * Meetings during w52 and 1 canceled
    * Next ordinary TC meeting on Jan 12th
* Monthly Community meetings
    * January meeting postponed to Jan 19th
    * Topic for Jan 19th: Protocol issue backlog cleanup
    * Action Emil: Update meeting invite to state the topic. On the Jan 12 TC meeting we'll decide which issues to actually talk about.
        * Done
    * Action Emil: Create a project board for the protocol to handle priorities for the protocol issues. Readable by all in the community and writeable by protocol maintainers.
        * Done: https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/projects/6/views/1
* Update to TC members list
    * Azeem will leave the TC now due to overbooked seats from Ericsson.
    * Action Magnus: Follow [checklist](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/howtos/introduction-of-a-new-tc-member.md) to revert Azeems's authorities etc
* https://www.youtube.com/@EiffelCommunity now shows more videos
* Scope and purpose of security officer issue ([github.com/eiffel-community/community#141](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/141))
    * Initial PR merged, still work TBD regarding maintainers' responsibilities and Dependabot.
* Eiffel TC Task board(s)
    * Add a dedicated protocol board with all protocol issues and clean up the [current TC board](https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/projects/3/views/4) to only contain "[community issues](https://github.com/search?l=&p=1&q=state%3Aopen+repo%3Aeiffel-community%2Feiffel-playground+repo%3Aeiffel-community%2Fcommunity+repo%3Aeiffel-community%2Feiffel-repository-template+repo%3Aeiffel-community%2Feiffel-community.github.io+repo%3Aeiffel-community%2F.github&ref=advsearch&type=Issues)"?
        * We'll add a new public board for protocol issues but more to prioritize them, e.g. for protocol workshops.
        * The existing TC board shouldn't get all protocol issues but rather those with a community impact, e.g. the YAML conversion, experimental versions, etc, but _not_ straight-up protocol changes like "add link type X to event Y".
    * Should e.g. [ER PR#12](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-event-repository/pull/12) really be on the TC board?
        * Maybe not, but let's keep it for now.
* TC being member of all maintainer Google groups (see AP below)
    * What role? A group cannot be a manager/owner
    * ![](https://i.imgur.com/KyFILA2.png)
    * Suggestion: Add all TC members individually, as owners, to each group
        * Yes. But no. See next point.
    * What about synch between the Google group and corresponding GitHub group? Could we script the updates of google groups?
        * Decision: Deprecate mailing lists in favor of GitHub discussions/issues/PRs. They're hardly used and mostly created administrative overhead. Draft issue created.
* Out of time, postponed: Reasoning about events as being in the traceability dimension or the activity dimension; should we document this and how?
* Out of time, postponed: [Common branching strategy?](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/150)
* Out of time, postponed: PRs and issues

    * Demo on Aug 24 of integration between Eiffel and CDEvents, building upon the old PoC of CDEvents.

* Follow-up from community meeting about deployment events on Aug 18th
    * No concrete outcome from last meeting.
    * To make the discussion move forward we should try structuring and scoping things better so we're not talking in circles. Maybe we can try copying CDEvents' deployment events and see if they'd work? Spending maybe on hour on that would probably help follow-up discussions a lot.
