## Overview

Eiffel Community is home to various projects that enable the members of the community to use, contribute,
and collaborate on Eiffel.

The projects that are part of Eiffel Community adhere to the processes and procedured set by the community
and follow the [project lifecycle process](./PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md) for their creation, progression, and
archival.

Projects hosted in Eiffel Community could utilize one or more repositories under Eiffel Community organization
on GitHub and the main project repository is where the project facts are documented.

This document lists existing projects, links to the main project repository, and the lifecycle stage the
projects currently reside in.

Any change to the project facts listed in this document shall be done according to the instructions documented
in [project lifecycle process](./PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md).

## Project Facts

The table below lists the projects hosted by Eiffel Community alphabetically with the protocol itself listed first.
All the projects are placed in to [Sandbox](./PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md#stage-sandbox) stage by default.

Please see [project lifecycle process](./PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md) for the project lifecycle and the stages.
