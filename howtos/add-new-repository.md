# Add a new repository to Eiffel Community

This document describes creation of a new repository for [the projects](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/PROJECTS.md)
that are already part of Eiffel Community.
If you intend to propose a new project to be hosted within Eiffel Community, please follow Project Lifecycle Process
documented [here](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md).

Want to extend the Eiffel community with a new repository?

1. Contact the community about the new repository you want to create, to see if it's a good fit. You can [create an issue](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/new) or post a question on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/eiffel-workspace/shared_invite/enQtOTI3MzEzMzY4Mzg0LTA3NDVmNjgzZjk1YTFjNzk5OWE4MjExYzE1ODU1NzA1YzY5MzhlZmYxZmIwMzhiM2ExOWM4ZGJlYzdkN2M5OTE).
1. Read through the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/eiffel-community/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/eiffel-community/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for Eiffel Community and understand the content.

1. Decide on a name for the repository. The Eiffel Community enforces no name convention but meaningful descriptive names are encouraged.
1. Create the repository in the [eiffel-community organization](https://github.com/organizations/eiffel-community/repositories/new). The repository should be public. Do NOT choose "import repository". The reason for this is to maintain a clean git history.
1. Copy the content of [eiffel-repository-template](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel-repository-template).
1. Follow the checklist in the repository template to update your repository structure.
1. (Optional) Spread the word about the new repository, on e.g. Slack!
